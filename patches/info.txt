* PHPIndexingVisitor.diff

Patches the indexingVisitor to pass over the IIndexingRequestor
to the extensions, otherwise it's not possible for extensions
to contribute elements to the SQL index.


* SemanticHighlightingManager.diff

Patches the extension loading implementation of the SemanticHighlighter
to avoid ClassNotFoundExceptions for highligher contributors.

The 2 patches will be applied by PDT developers to the 
CVS repository, until then they have to be applied manually,
otherwise you'll get compilation errors.
